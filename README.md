## Overview

This document brings together multiple classic topics in operating systems and concurrent programming:
- **I/O System Calls**: Using low-level Unix system calls (`open`, `read`, `write`, and `close`) for file operations.
- **Process System Calls**: Creating and managing processes using `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()`.
- **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**: Implementing First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) and Round Robin scheduling.
- **Producer-Consumer Problem**: Solving synchronization issues using semaphores and POSIX threads.

Each section includes complete code samples and detailed explanations to make it easier to understand and present these concepts.

## I/O System Calls in Unix

### I/O Code Listing

```c
#include <stdio.h>    // For printf(), perror(), getchar()
#include <fcntl.h>    // For open() and file control options
#include <unistd.h>   // For read(), write(), close(), lseek()
#include <stdlib.h>   // For exit()

int main() {
    int fd;
    ssize_t bytesRead, bytesWritten;
    char buffer[100];

    // Open the file "example.txt" for reading and writing.
    // O_CREAT: Create the file if it doesn't exist.
    // O_RDWR: Open for reading and writing.
    // O_TRUNC: Truncate the file if it exists.
    fd = open("example.txt", O_CREAT | O_RDWR | O_TRUNC, 0644);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Write text to the file.
    const char *text = "Hello, Unix I/O system calls!\n";
    bytesWritten = write(fd, text, 30);  // Writes 30 bytes from 'text'
    if (bytesWritten == -1) {
        perror("Error writing to file");
        close(fd);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Reposition the file offset to the beginning of the file.
    lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET);

    // Read from the file into the buffer.
    bytesRead = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    if (bytesRead == -1) {
        perror("Error reading file");
        close(fd);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Null-terminate the string and display it.
    buffer[bytesRead] = '\0';
    printf("File content:\n%s", buffer);

    // Close the file descriptor.
    if (close(fd) == -1) {
        perror("Error closing file");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### I/O Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Header Inclusions:**
   - `<stdio.h>`: For input/output functions (e.g., `printf()`, `perror()`).
   - `<fcntl.h>`: Provides the `open()` function and file control options.
   - `<unistd.h>`: Contains system calls like `read()`, `write()`, `close()`, and `lseek()`.
   - `<stdlib.h>`: Used for the `exit()` function and other utilities.

2. **Main Function Declaration:**
   - `int main()`: The starting point of the program.

3. **Variable Declarations:**
   - `int fd;`: File descriptor used to refer to the file.
   - `ssize_t bytesRead, bytesWritten;`: To store the number of bytes read/written (using `ssize_t` to handle potential negative errors).
   - `char buffer[100];`: Buffer to store file data.

4. **File Opening:**
   - `open("example.txt", O_CREAT | O_RDWR | O_TRUNC, 0644);`: Opens (or creates) a file with read/write permissions; if the file exists, it is truncated.
   - Error checking is done using `if (fd == -1)`.

5. **Writing to the File:**
   - `write(fd, text, 30);`: Writes 30 bytes from `text` into the file.
   - Checks if the write operation fails.

6. **Repositioning File Offset:**
   - `lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET);`: Moves the file pointer back to the beginning so that the subsequent read operation starts at the beginning.

7. **Reading from the File:**
   - `read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1);`: Reads up to 99 bytes from the file into `buffer`.
   - Checks for read errors and then null-terminates the string.

8. **Printing the Buffer:**
   - `printf("File content:\n%s", buffer);`: Displays the content read from the file.

9. **Closing the File:**
   - `close(fd);`: Closes the file descriptor, ensuring all resources are freed.
   - Checks for errors during closing.

## Process System Calls

### Process Code Listing

```c
#include <stdio.h>    // For printf(), perror()
#include <unistd.h>   // For fork(), execlp(), getpid(), getppid()
#include <sys/wait.h> // For wait(), WIFEXITED, WEXITSTATUS

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();  // Create a new process

    if (pid < 0) {  // Error check for fork()
        perror("Fork failed");
        return 1;
    }

    if (pid == 0) {  // Child process block
        printf("Child Process (PID: %d, Parent PID: %d)\n", getpid(), getppid());
        // Replace child process with 'ls -l'
        execlp("ls", "ls", "-l", NULL);
        perror("Exec failed");  // If exec fails, print error
        return 1;
    } else {  // Parent process block
        printf("Parent Process (PID: %d, Child PID: %d)\n", getpid(), pid);
        int status;
        wait(&status);  // Wait for the child to finish
        if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
            printf("Child exited with status %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
        } else {
            printf("Child did not exit properly\n");
        }
    }

    printf("Process (PID: %d) finished.\n", getpid());
    return 0;
}
```

### Process Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Header Inclusions:**
   - `<stdio.h>`: Provides functions for printing and error reporting.
   - `<unistd.h>`: Contains process-related system calls like `fork()`, `execlp()`, `getpid()`, and `getppid()`.
   - `<sys/wait.h>`: Offers `wait()` and macros to inspect child process exit status.

2. **Main Function Declaration:**
   - `int main()`: The entry point of the program.

3. **Forking a New Process:**
   - `pid_t pid = fork();`: The `fork()` call creates a new process.
     - Returns `0` for the child process.
     - Returns the child's PID for the parent.
     - Returns a negative value if an error occurs.

4. **Error Handling for Fork:**
   - `if (pid < 0)`: Checks if the fork failed.
   - `perror("Fork failed");`: Outputs an error message if fork fails.

5. **Child Process Block:**
   - `if (pid == 0)`: Identifies the child process.
   - `printf("Child Process...")`: Prints the childâ€™s PID and its parent's PID.
   - `execlp("ls", "ls", "-l", NULL);`: Replaces the child process with the `ls -l` command.
   - If `execlp()` fails, `perror("Exec failed")` is executed.

6. **Parent Process Block:**
   - The `else` block executes only in the parent.
   - `printf("Parent Process...")`: Displays the parent's PID and the child's PID.
   - `wait(&status);`: The parent waits until the child process finishes.
   - Macros `WIFEXITED` and `WEXITSTATUS` check and print the child's exit status.

7. **Final Output:**
   - `printf("Process (PID: %d) finished.\n", getpid());`: Prints a termination message.
   - `return 0;`: Exits successfully.

## CPU Scheduling Algorithms

### FCFS Scheduling

#### FCFS Code Listing

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i;
    int burst_time[20], waiting_time[20], turnaround_time[20];
    float total_waiting_time = 0, total_turnaround_time = 0;

    // Input the number of processes
    printf("Enter the number of processes: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Input burst time for each process
    printf("Enter burst time for each process:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Process %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%d", &burst_time[i]);
    }

    // Calculate waiting time: first process waits 0
    waiting_time[0] = 0;
    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        waiting_time[i] = waiting_time[i - 1] + burst_time[i - 1];
    }

    // Calculate turnaround time for each process and accumulate totals
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        turnaround_time[i] = waiting_time[i] + burst_time[i];
        total_waiting_time += waiting_time[i];
        total_turnaround_time += turnaround_time[i];
    }

    // Display the results in a table format
    printf("\nProcess\tBurst Time\tWaiting Time\tTurnaround Time\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("P%d\t\t%d\t\t%d\t\t%d\n", i + 1, burst_time[i], waiting_time[i], turnaround_time[i]);
    }

    // Calculate and display averages
    printf("\nAverage Waiting Time: %.2f\n", total_waiting_time / n);
    printf("Average Turnaround Time: %.2f\n", total_turnaround_time / n);

    return 0;
}
```

#### FCFS Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Include Standard I/O:**
   - `#include <stdio.h>`: For input and output operations.

2. **Main Function and Variable Declarations:**
   - `int n, i;`: `n` stores the number of processes, `i` is used for looping.
   - Arrays `burst_time`, `waiting_time`, and `turnaround_time` hold each processâ€™s CPU burst, waiting, and turnaround times.
   - `total_waiting_time` and `total_turnaround_time` accumulate totals to compute averages.

3. **Input Section:**
   - Prompts the user for the number of processes and the burst time of each process.

4. **Waiting Time Calculation:**
   - The first process has zero waiting time.
   - For each subsequent process, waiting time is the sum of burst times of all preceding processes.

5. **Turnaround Time Calculation:**
   - Turnaround time is the sum of waiting time and burst time for each process.
   - Totals are accumulated for average calculation.

6. **Output Section:**
   - Displays the burst, waiting, and turnaround times for each process.
   - Computes and prints the average waiting and turnaround times.

### Round Robin Scheduling

#### Round Robin Code Listing

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i, time, remaining, flag = 0;
    int time_quantum;
    int wait_time = 0, turnaround_time = 0;
    int burst_time[20], remaining_time[20];

    // Input the number of processes
    printf("Enter the number of processes: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    remaining = n;  // Number of processes yet to finish

    // Input burst time for each process and initialize remaining time
    printf("Enter burst time for each process:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Process %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%d", &burst_time[i]);
        remaining_time[i] = burst_time[i];
    }

    // Input the fixed time quantum
    printf("Enter time quantum: ");
    scanf("%d", &time_quantum);

    printf("\nProcess\tBurst Time\tWaiting Time\tTurnaround Time\n");
    
    // Simulation loop for round robin scheduling
    for (time = 0, i = 0; remaining != 0;) {
        if (remaining_time[i] <= time_quantum && remaining_time[i] > 0) {
            time += remaining_time[i];
            remaining_time[i] = 0;
            flag = 1;
        } else if (remaining_time[i] > 0) {
            remaining_time[i] -= time_quantum;
            time += time_quantum;
        }

        // If a process finished in this cycle, calculate its metrics
        if (remaining_time[i] == 0 && flag == 1) {
            remaining--;
            printf("P%d\t\t%d\t\t%d\t\t%d\n", i + 1, burst_time[i], time - burst_time[i], time);
            wait_time += time - burst_time[i];
            turnaround_time += time;
            flag = 0;
        }
        // Move to the next process cyclically
        i = (i + 1) % n;
    }

    // Display average waiting and turnaround times
    printf("\nAverage Waiting Time: %.2f\n", (float)wait_time / n);
    printf("Average Turnaround Time: %.2f\n", (float)turnaround_time / n);

    return 0;
}
```

#### Round Robin Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Include Standard I/O:**
   - `#include <stdio.h>`: Provides functions for input and output.

2. **Main Function and Variable Declarations:**
   - Declares variables for process count, looping, and time.
   - `burst_time[]` and `remaining_time[]` hold the initial burst times and the remaining CPU time for each process.
   - `wait_time` and `turnaround_time` accumulate the totals.

3. **Input Section:**
   - Reads the number of processes.
   - For each process, inputs the burst time and sets the corresponding remaining time.
   - Reads the time quantumâ€”the fixed time each process is allowed in one cycle.

4. **Round Robin Scheduling Simulation:**
   - A loop runs until all processes have finished (`remaining != 0`).
   - For each process:
     - If the remaining time is less than or equal to the time quantum, the process completes in this cycle.
     - Otherwise, it uses up a time quantum and its remaining time is reduced.
   - When a process finishes, its waiting and turnaround times are computed and printed.
   - The index `i` is updated in a cyclic manner using the modulo operator.

5. **Output Section:**
   - Prints each processâ€™s waiting and turnaround times.
   - Computes and displays average waiting and turnaround times.

    int item;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        item = rand() % 100;         // Generate a random item between 0 and 99.
        sem_wait(&empty);            // Wait until there is an empty slot.
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);  // Lock the mutex to access the shared buffer.
        buffer[in] = item;           // Place the produced item into the buffer.
        printf("Produced: %d\n", item);
        in = (in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE; // Move to the next slot in a circular manner.
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);  // Unlock the mutex.
        sem_post(&full);             // Signal that a new item is available.
        sleep(1);                    // Simulate production time.
    }
    return NULL;
}

// Consumer function: consumes 10 items.
void *consumer(void *arg) {
    int item;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        sem_wait(&full);             // Wait until at least one item is available.
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);  // Lock the mutex to access the shared buffer.
        item = buffer[out];          // Retrieve the item from the buffer.
        printf("Consumed: %d\n", item);
        out = (out + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;  // Move to the next slot in a circular manner.
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);  // Unlock the mutex.
        sem_post(&empty);            // Signal that a slot is now free.
        sleep(1);                    // Simulate consumption time.
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t prod, cons;  // Thread identifiers for producer and consumer

    // Initialize semaphores:
    // 'full' starts at 0 since the buffer is initially empty.
    sem_init(&full, 0, 0);
    // 'empty' starts at BUFFER_SIZE because all slots are free.
    sem_init(&empty, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
    // Initialize the mutex for exclusive access to the buffer.
    pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL);
    
    // Create the producer and consumer threads.
    pthread_create(&prod, NULL, producer, NULL);
    pthread_create(&cons, NULL, consumer, NULL);
    
    // Wait for both threads to finish.
    pthread_join(prod, NULL);
    pthread_join(cons, NULL);
    
    // Clean up: destroy the semaphores and mutex.
    sem_destroy(&full);
    sem_destroy(&empty);
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex);
    
    return 0;
}
```
